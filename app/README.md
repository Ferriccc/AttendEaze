# AttendEaze

My first Flutter project.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for my Flutter journey.

This app aims to ease out the process of marking attendence, with beautiful UI and security of Google OAuth.

Note: I am a begginer, so all your suggestions and constructive criticism are more than welcome, If you want to request a feature or report a bug or give suggest efficient ways of already implemented functionality, you can reach me out at shrey.s4@ahduni.edu.in.

### Important!

This app is configured with rest apis that are not in this repo, so this app wont be able to run except on my local machine unless I buy a server to host it, what you can do?...either sponsor me or can just see my work.

#### Have a good day!
